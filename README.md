# Gauntlet

This project is the mobile component of the Nine Worlds Deep ecosystem. 

NineWorldsDeep is a node based ecosystem created with the intent of practicing and exploring interconnected disciplines.

It aims to achieve this through facilitating the storage and retrieval of "linkable", "taggable", "hashable" fragments of creative and investigative works in progress.

Gauntlet allows the user to tag and link hashable media and related textual information from any compatible android device. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [NineWorldsDeep](https://github.com/BBuchholz/NineWorldsDeep) desktop application.
