# Gauntlet

Developers Note: "NineWorldsDeep" and "Gauntlet" are working development names, specifically tied to the organic growth of these projects. The current, though subject to change, working title on public release will be "messaround", reflecting the general tone of the ecosystem.

This project is a part of the Nine Worlds Deep ecosystem, which is a collection 
of toy projects that grew together over time to become more useful together. It 
is currently in experimental development and I would direct any curious parties to the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/BBuchholz/Gauntlet/wiki)
(which currently contains my personal working notes).

I will change this README when that status changes, until then, 
assume that much is left out, and I make zero claims or assurances 
as to the validity or usefulness of anything here.
